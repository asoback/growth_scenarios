      <!--About-->
      <div>
        <p>
          People are not computers, we are not good at estimating exponential growth and decline.
          That is why most people tend to underestimate compound interest, whether its credit card
          debt, or investments. This project is meant to help visualize growth and decline, for
          our total energy supply and demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The energy plot starts at 1, for the total demand, and total consumption, from all
          sources combined. Think of this as a ratio compared to what we used in 1980. 
          When the demand line hits two, that means the demand is double that of 1980, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data here is smoothed, as we don't need to be concerned with the actual, specific
          numbers. We want to consider average growth and decline. No one can predict the future.

          An energy crisis will occur, where demand has seriously outpaced supply. If a complete
          societal collapse can be avoided, quality of life will have fallen, and cost of living
          skyrocketed.
        </p>
        <p class="warning-message" id="warn_high_undiscovered_resources">
          If more undiscovered resources exist, their extraction is likely expensive, unprofitable,
          and environmentally damaging.
        </p>
        <p class="warning-message" id="energy_per_cap_low">
          Energy per person is lower than the average American. 
          Either Americans have reduced their quality of life, or the global poor are permanently 
          trapped at the bottom of the class hierarchy, and economic mobility has become impossible.
        </p>
        <p class="warning-message" id="warn_low_energy_demand">
          The growth of demand is slower than historical trends.

                  This is the point at which Earth's total human population
                  will stabilize. This assumes that we want to avoid a collapse, where billions of
                  people die, and that at some point, humanities population growth (on Earth) plateaus. If 
                  it does not, we will have an Earthly population of over 25 billion in 100 years, and
                  over 85 billion in 200 years. This would require a serious reorganization of land use 
                  and production.

                  If we want to raise everyone's standard of living to that of the average
                  Japanese person, this requires a per capita consumption of 2. If we want everyone to live like
                  the average American, this requires per capita energy consumption of 4. If instead we
                  wanted to drop everyone's consumption to match that of the average Indian, we could drop
                  the number to only .25.
